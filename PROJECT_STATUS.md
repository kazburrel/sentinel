# Project Status — full history for Codex context (rewritten, major update)

## Goal

Battery-powered motion-triggered camera on a Freenove ESP32-S3-WROOM CAM board:
AM312 PIR sensor detects motion → ESP32-S3 captures a JPEG from the onboard camera →
image is sent to a server (Ollama locally in dev, RunPod serverless in prod) for AI
vision processing → phone gets notified. Firmware is Rust (`esp-hal`, no_std, Embassy
async runtime via `esp-rtos`).

## Hardware

- Freenove ESP32-S3-WROOM CAM board, native USB-Serial/JTAG, no external UART bridge
- **The camera sensor is an OV3660, not an OV2640** (this was wrong for most of the
  project — see "Major discovery" below). Confirmed by physically reading the label
  printed on the camera module's ribbon cable.
- AM312 PIR sensor, wired: `VCC→3V3`, `OUT→GPIO21`, `GND→GND`
- Onboard WS2812 addressable RGB LED on GPIO48
- Camera pin map (confirmed correct for this board): XCLK/MCLK=15, PCLK=13, VSYNC=6,
  HREF=7, D0-D7=11,9,8,10,12,18,17,16, SCCB SDA=4, SCCB SCL=5
- Dev machine: MacBook Pro M1 Max, macOS Darwin 25.5.0, Apple Silicon

## Milestones completed and verified on real hardware

**Milestone 1 — first flash/serial loop.** Verified board detection, ESP32-S3 v0.2/8MB
flash identified via `espflash board-info`, repeating "alive" message over
`esp_println`. Committed in `c7937c4`.

**Milestone 2 — PIR motion detection.** GPIO21 digital input, edge-triggered
(`motion detected`/`motion stopped`). Verified against real arm movement. Committed in
`a08771a`.

**Milestone 3 — WS2812 LED feedback.** GPIO48 driven via raw `esp_hal::rmt`/`PulseCode`
(hand-rolled bit timing after both `esp-hal-smartled` and `esp-hal-smartled2` proved
unusable). LED off at rest, dim red on motion, off after. Code organized into
`firmware/src/pir.rs`, `firmware/src/ws2812.rs`, `firmware/src/lib.rs`. Committed in
`305d75f` — **still the last commit; nothing camera-related is committed yet.**

## Milestone 4 — camera capture: MAJOR DISCOVERY, currently mid-Rust-port

This milestone went through a long, mostly-mistaken debugging saga, then a real
breakthrough, and is now in a fresh, well-understood-but-unsolved state. Read in order:

### What actually happened (the short version)

1. Assumed the sensor was OV2640 (per original hardware ID, which turned out wrong).
2. Tried the experimental crate `esp32s3-cam-async` → total silence, no serial output.
3. Tried `esp-hal`'s own official OV2640 example → also total silence.
4. Spent a very long time debugging this as a suspected hang: `probe-rs` hardware
   debugger sessions, register/backtrace analysis via `addr2line`, stack-overflow
   theories, RAM-pressure theories, clean incremental bisection back to the last known
   working commit. All of this is preserved in `FOR_CODEX.md` (UPDATE 1-8) for
   reference, but **the conclusion at the end of that investigation was wrong** — see
   next point.
5. **Breakthrough**: switched to a completely different toolchain (Arduino + the
   mature, official `esp32-camera` C library) to check whether the camera hardware
   itself worked at all, independent of our Rust code. It also appeared silent at
   first — until a test was written that repeated its result **forever in a loop**
   instead of printing once. That immediately revealed: **the camera was working
   correctly the entire time.** There was never a hang, in Rust or Arduino. Every
   earlier test only printed its result once, and that single print consistently
   landed in the same narrow window our serial reader misses right after a board
   reset/replug (the reader takes a moment to attach after the physical USB
   reconnect). The "hang" was 100% an artifact of test methodology, not a real
   firmware or hardware fault.
6. While getting a clean capture in Arduino, noticed the camera module's ribbon-cable
   label actually reads **"OV3660"**, not OV2640. This had been assumed wrong since
   the very start of camera work. Every prior register-init sequence (both the
   experimental crate and the official esp-hal example) was silently doing OV2640
   register writes to a different chip the whole time — which may also have
   contributed to earlier confusion, though the "hang" itself is now known to be
   unrelated to this (see point 5 — even Arduino's *correct*, auto-detecting OV3660
   driver looked silent at first for the same observability reason).
7. Got a real, valid JPEG photo (640×480, then pushed to full-sensor UXGA 1600×1200)
   out of the board via Arduino, confirmed by opening the reconstructed `.jpg` file.
   Iterated on transfer speed (raw binary instead of hex text, 921600 baud instead of
   115200 — ~16x faster) and turned it into an on-demand "capture now" trigger
   instead of a fixed timer, landing at ~3 seconds from trigger to a saved,
   viewable UXGA photo. A reusable script, `capture.sh`, automates this end to end
   (finds the port, triggers capture, extracts the JPEG from the raw serial stream,
   saves timestamped to `~/Desktop`, opens it).
8. Started porting this proven-working setup back to Rust (the Arduino work was
   always meant as a diagnostic detour, not a replacement — see next section).
   **This port is where we are now, and it has hit a new, real, not-yet-understood
   bug** (see "Current blocker" below) — genuinely different from the earlier "hang,"
   which is fully resolved/understood.

### The Rust OV3660 port (in progress)

New file `firmware/src/ov3660.rs`: a from-scratch OV3660 SCCB driver, ported from
Espressif's real `esp32-camera` library (`sensors/ov3660.c`,
`sensors/private_include/ov3660_settings.h`/`ov3660_regs.h`) — **not hand-transcribed**,
extracted programmatically with a Python script to avoid copy-transcription errors
(a real bug was caught and fixed this way: the first extraction pass incorrectly
included 16 commented-out register entries from the source file; a second pass that
strips `//` comments before parsing fixed it — final table is 199 register-writes,
verified against the source).

Contents:
- `OV3660_DEFAULT_REGS` (199 entries) + `OV3660_FMT_JPEG` (6 entries) — `(u16, u16)`
  register/value tables (OV3660 uses 16-bit SCCB register addresses, unlike OV2640's
  8-bit ones)
- `Ov3660::check_id()` — reads the real 16-bit product ID (registers `0x300A`/`0x300B`)
  and confirms it equals `0x3660`, rather than assuming the sensor type
- `Ov3660::init_jpeg(quality)` — soft reset, writes the default-regs table, writes the
  JPEG-format table, sets the quality register (`0x4407` = `COMPRESSION_CTRL07`)
- Uses I2C address `0x3C` (7-bit) — **note:** this was originally `0x30` (copied
  from the OV2640 assumption without re-verifying) and caused the first blocker below;
  now fixed and confirmed against Espressif's real source
  (`OV3660_SCCB_ADDR = 0x3C`, vs `OV2640_SCCB_ADDR = 0x30`, in
  `esp32-camera/driver/include/sensor.h`)
- `firmware/src/bin/camera_test.rs` was rewritten to use this new driver, keeping the
  exact same `esp_hal::lcd_cam::cam::Camera`/DMA setup as the earlier OV2640 attempt
  (that part was proven correct and was never the actual problem)
- Applied the methodology lesson directly: this firmware prints its status
  **repeatedly, forever**, not once — so if something actually goes wrong, it cannot
  silently look like a hang the way earlier one-shot-print tests did.

### Blocker #1 (SOLVED): wrong I2C address

`Ov3660::check_id()` failed every attempt with
`I2c(AcknowledgeCheckFailed(Address))` — a real, immediate error (not the old hang
observability issue), meaning the sensor wasn't acknowledging its address at all. Spent
a while ruling out pull-ups and bus frequency with source-level evidence (both
confirmed correct against `esp-hal-1.1.1/src/i2c/master/mod.rs`) and tried a
clock-before-I2C reordering theory — none of it was the cause.

**Root cause:** `OV3660_ADDRESS` was set to `0x30`, copied from the original OV2640
assumption without re-verifying for the actual sensor. Espressif's real
`esp32-camera/driver/include/sensor.h` defines `OV2640_SCCB_ADDR = 0x30` but
`OV3660_SCCB_ADDR = 0x3C` — different sensors, different default SCCB address. Fixed
by changing the constant to `0x3C`. **This resolved the NACK completely** — `check_id()`
now succeeds, chip ID confirms as a real OV3660, and `init_jpeg()` (the full 199+6
register write sequence) completes without any I2C error.

### Blocker #2a (SOLVED): DMA started too early

Original code called `camera.receive(dma_rx_buf)` *before* the I2C/SCCB setup, on the
theory that the physical XCLK signal might not start until `.receive()` began (this
theory turned out wrong). The real problem: a small 20KB DMA descriptor chain, started
that early, can exhaust itself during the ~1s+ of I2C setup (500ms wait + chip-ID
retries + 200+ register writes) *before we ever get around to reading from it* —
producing `transfer.is_done()` with no real EOF ever having been consumed. Fixed by
reordering: full I2C/SCCB setup (`check_id()` + `init_jpeg()`) now happens first,
`camera.receive()` is called last, immediately followed by reading. This matches the
official esp-hal example's ordering. **After this fix, warmup-frame skipping succeeds**
— no more "DMA warmup never completed."

### Blocker #2b (SOLVED): per-byte `print!()` was too slow to keep up with the DMA

Confirmed Codex's diagnosis exactly: the real-frame loop was doing `print!("{b:02X}")`
for every single byte *before* consuming it, while the warmup loop just consumed
immediately with no printing. That per-byte formatting/serial-write was far slower than
the incoming DMA data rate, so the 20KB ring buffer filled and finished before EOF ever
appeared. Removed the per-byte print entirely (just accumulate `frame_len` and consume
immediately) — **capture now completes successfully end to end**: the firmware's
forever-repeating status line reports `still alive: last capture was 5594570 bytes`.
The full pipeline (SCCB config → DMA receive → warmup discard → real frame → EOF) now
works in Rust.

**New concern surfaced by this success**: 5,594,570 bytes (~5.6MB) is suspiciously huge
for one JPEG frame — Arduino's UXGA captures were only ~100-300KB. This is more evidence
for the still-open `set_framesize()` gap: without it, the sensor may be outputting at
some much larger/less-compressed default rather than a sane resolution. Not yet fixed.

### Blocker #2c (SOLVED): frame size — needed `set_framesize()`'s compression-enable bit

Confirmed exactly right: `OV3660_FMT_JPEG` only selected YUV formatting, never actually
set register `0x3821`'s compression-enable bit (`0x20`), so the sensor was emitting
~5.6MB of uncompressed data. Ported a minimal, hardcoded VGA (640x480) version of
`set_framesize()`/`set_image_options()` (crop window, binning/scaling, JPEG-compression
enable, 20MHz-XCLK PLL settings — new const table `OV3660_FRAMESIZE_VGA` in
`ov3660.rs`, written right after `OV3660_FMT_JPEG` in `init_jpeg()`). **Frame size
dropped from 5,594,570 bytes to 12,288 bytes** — the right order of magnitude for a
real compressed VGA JPEG (Arduino's VGA captures were 14-32KB, so this is in-range,
maybe a touch small/aggressive but clearly real compression is happening now).

### DONE: verified the actual bytes are a valid, viewable JPEG — MILESTONE 4 COMPLETE

Implemented the buffered approach: a 64KB static buffer (`StaticCell`) that the fast
count-only DMA loop copies chunks into (no printing during the live loop), then dumps
as hex — repeated every 10s forever, not once, same reliability lesson as everywhere
else in this project. Captured, reconstructed with `xxd -r -p`, and verified:

```
JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, ..., 640x480, components 3
```

**A real, valid, correct-resolution photo, captured entirely by the Rust firmware —
no Arduino/experimental-crate dependency needed.** This closes out the entire camera
capture investigation. The full chain of fixes, in order: wrong sensor assumed
(OV2640→OV3660) → wrong I2C address (`0x30`→`0x3C`) → DMA started before I2C setup
(reordered) → per-byte `print!()` too slow during capture (removed, buffered instead)
→ missing JPEG-compression-enable bit in `set_framesize()` (ported a minimal hardcoded
VGA version) → buffered capture + dump to get real bytes off-device. Every one of
these was found and fixed with actual evidence (source code, real error messages,
concrete byte counts), not guessing.

## Next steps (not yet started)

- Clean up `firmware/src/bin/camera_test.rs` (currently a diagnostic binary with
  verbose repeated dumping) into a proper reusable capture function/module, mirroring
  how `pir.rs`/`ws2812.rs` were factored out after their own proof-of-concept stages.
- Integrate camera capture into the real `firmware/src/bin/main.rs` (PIR-triggered,
  not the standalone always-on-boot test it is now).
- `arduino-camera-test/`, `capture.sh`, and `bisection-artifacts/` (the diagnostic-only
  detour artifacts) have been deleted — no longer needed now that the Rust firmware
  works on its own. `firmware/src/bin/camera_test.rs` is still around and still needs
  the refactor/integration above.
- `FOR_CODEX.md`'s original content (UPDATE 1-8) can likely be deleted entirely now —
  it documents a hang that was never real, and is superseded by this file.
- Nothing camera-related is committed to git yet — worth committing once the above
  cleanup/integration decisions are made.

## Current exact codebase state

**Committed to git** (still only through `305d75f`): milestone 1-3 firmware (PIR +
WS2812), workspace structure, `shared`/`server` scaffolding. Nothing camera-related has
been committed yet — all of the below is uncommitted working-tree state.

**Uncommitted, current:**
- `firmware/src/bin/main.rs` — back to the pure, unmodified milestone-3 PIR/LED
  version (matches `305d75f` exactly; the camera diagnostic mess from earlier in this
  saga has been fully reverted out of this file)
- `firmware/src/bin/camera_test.rs` — **new, separate binary target** (added a second
  `[[bin]]` entry in `Cargo.toml`), the OV3660 Rust port described above, **now fully
  working end to end** (verified valid 640x480 JPEG capture)
- `firmware/src/ov3660.rs` — new OV3660 driver module, described above
- `firmware/src/lib.rs` — now also declares `pub mod ov3660;`
- `firmware/Cargo.toml` — the experimental `esp32s3-cam-async` dependency has been
  **removed** (no longer used at all); only stock `esp-hal` is used for camera work now
- `FOR_CODEX.md` — the (now largely obsolete/resolved) hang-investigation log,
  UPDATE 1-8. Kept for reference/history but its central conclusion (there's a real
  hang somewhere) is now known to be wrong — see "Major discovery" above.
- `NEXT_STEP.md` — untracked by design (user preference, never `git add` this file)
- `arduino-camera-test/`, `capture.sh`, `bisection-artifacts/` — the Arduino/C++
  diagnostic detour and old bisection investigation artifacts. **Deleted** — served
  their purpose (proving the camera hardware worked, isolating the real bugs) and
  aren't needed now that the Rust firmware works on its own. (`arduino-cli` + the
  ESP32 Arduino core are still installed on this Mac as tooling, just not project
  files — harmless to leave or remove independently.)

## Hardware/tooling quirks discovered this project (useful context, not bugs to fix)

- macOS's "Allow accessory to connect?" security prompt can silently block the serial
  port until approved.
- This board's native USB-Serial/JTAG can get stuck in bootloader/download mode after
  `espflash`'s software reset sequence — a full physical unplug/replug reliably fixes
  it; a bare RESET press sometimes doesn't.
- `/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX`'s numeric suffix changes across replugs (seen `1101` and
  `101` in the same session) — always re-`ls` before flashing/reading.
- **The single biggest lesson of this entire milestone**: a firmware test that prints
  its result exactly once is not trustworthy for hang/crash diagnosis on this board,
  because the host-side serial reader takes a moment to attach after every
  reset/replug, and that window reliably eats the first print(s). Any diagnostic
  firmware from here on should report status repeatedly/forever, never as a one-shot.
- `probe-rs` (installed this session, works via the ESP32-S3's built-in USB-JTAG) is
  a real, working hardware debugger for this board — useful for register-level
  inspection when actually needed, but not a substitute for first ruling out the
  observability issue above.
- Xtensa's windowed-register ABI encodes call-size bits in the top 2 bits of `a0`
  (return address register) — real address is `(a0 & 0x3FFFFFFF) | 0x40000000`.
  Only relevant if doing manual register/backtrace analysis again.
- `arduino-cli` + ESP32 core work fine as a side-by-side toolchain to the Rust/esp-hal
  one on this same Mac; useful for hardware-vs-software isolation testing. FQBN used:
  `esp32:esp32:esp32s3:CDCOnBoot=cdc,PSRAM=opi`.

## What's needed from Codex right now

Nothing blocking — **Milestone 4 is complete.** One small fix already applied since
the last update: `JPEG_BUF.init(...)` was changed to `JPEG_BUF.init_with(...)` to
avoid constructing the 64KB array on the stack first (the same class of bug we hit
earlier with `DMA_CHUNK`/`JPEG_OUT` in the experimental-crate attempt). See "Next
steps" above for what's next (refactor into a reusable module, integrate with PIR,
decide what to do with the diagnostic artifacts) — open to input on any of those, but
none of them are blockers.
